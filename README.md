# P1NG ‚Äì Your Lightweight, Database-less Internet Speed Tester

> **No accounts. No storage. Just raw speed insights.**

---

## üåê What is P1NG?

**P1NG** is a simple, database-free speed testing backend service that lets users check their **download speed**, **upload speed**, and **network latency (ping + jitter + packet loss)** ‚Äî instantly, and without storing any personal data.

### Why P1NG?

* **Database-less** ‚Äî No user-specific data is stored.
* **Real-time Testing** ‚Äî Run tests directly from your frontend app.
* **Smart Server Selection** ‚Äî Auto-selects the best test server (feature-ready).
* **Configurable Backend URLs** ‚Äî You can easily route your frontend to regional servers (e.g., `np.backend.com` for Nepal or `us.backend.com` for the US).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Flow)

1. **Start the Test** from the frontend.
2. The backend:

   * Measures **download** speed by sending a data stream.
   * Accepts **upload** data to evaluate upstream bandwidth.
   * Uses the **ping** endpoint to calculate latency, jitter, and packet loss.
   * Can **fetch your IP details** for extra insights (like ISP and city).
   * Uses the **server selection API** to route to the closest/best location.

> üí° *We do not store or log your activity. All tests are conducted in real time and forgotten instantly.*

---
### Frontend
> **Note:**
> The backend is production-ready and fully functional. However, the frontend is currently in a prototype phase, primarily showcasing the integration between UI and core services.

> Since we haven't yet deployed global server infrastructure or partnered with server providers, you may not receive the most precise results‚Äîespecially if you're far from the default server location.

## üåç Server Flexibility

We understand running global servers can be costly. That‚Äôs why P1NG is built with flexibility in mind.

P1NG supports **dynamic server selection**  the ability to choose the best server based on the user's location only.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **However, as of now, we do not have any physical server details configured in the backend.**

So while the feature is built and available via the `/select_server` endpoint, **it may not work out of the box unless you add your own servers.**


###  How to Add Your Own  Servers

1. Open the `server_config.py` file in the backend.
2. Add entries for your physical servers like:

```python
test_servers = [
    {
        "id": "nep-lumbini-001",
        "name": "p1ng - Lumbini",
        "hostname": "127.0.0.1:8000 ",
        "ip": "103.152.144.29",
        "port": 443,
        "protocols_supported": ["https", "http", "ws"],
        "location": {
            "city": "Butwal",
            "region": "Lumbini Province",
            "country": "Nepal",
            "continent": "Asia",
            "lat": 27.6939,
            "lon": 83.4453,
            "timezone": "Asia/Kathmandu"
        },
        "server_capabilities": {
            "max_bandwidth_mbps": 1000,
            "supports_ipv6": True,
            "ssl_certified": True,
            "uptime_percent": 99.99
        },
        "admin_contact": {
            "name": "Dorna Raj Gyawali",
            "email": "dronarajgyawali.gmail.com"
        },
        "meta": {
            "last_updated": "2025-07-18T12:00:00Z",
            "version": "1.2.0",
            "description": "Community-hosted high-performance test node.",
            "tags": ["community", "lumbini", "nepal", "fast"]
        }
    }
]
```

3. Ensure those backend servers are live and running the P1NG backend service.

Now, the system will automatically route users to the best backend for their location using the `/select_server` API.
